											business and web development as well.</p>

									<h2>Experience</h2>
									<p>I have a wide array of skills that I've developed during my time as a teacher and as a business leader.
									I specialize in communication and connectivity, and I have a mindset for bringing people and 
									resources together more efficiently.  Below are the key skills that I possess, as well as the relative 
									strength of, or length of time spent developing that skill.</p>

								<p class="content">My last job was working with a company called Global Knowledge, 
									a Skillsoft Company, which I started in 2016.  I was first employed as a technical 
									trainer, and I primarily taught Microsoft Office applications to claiments with the 
									Workers Compensation Board of Alberta, who were being re-trained for work in an office 
									setting.  Then, during a corporate buy-out, I moved into managment for the facility, 
									and I served as both the technical specialist and the operations manager in this regard.  
									As the technical specialist, I was responsible for overseeing the hardware and software 
									within the facility, as well as preparing classrooms for specific courses, either by 
									installing the necessary software, or by building and connecting virtual machines to 
									run courses.  As the operations manager, I would oversee the cleanliness of the facility, 
									as well as manage the course delivery schedules and the course catering orders.  If any 
									issues arose, such as a complaint, or a facility management issue, then it was also my 
									responsibility to handle it.<br /><br />

									At the onset of the pandemic, I was able to convert one of our primary course offerings 
									into an online offering, so that we could continue to operate into the pandemic, despite 
									the lockdown measures.  I was directly responsible for overseeing the entire transition 
									and delivery of this course from an operations standpoint, and also served as the lead 
									technical specialist for the first eight months of the lockdowns.  To facilitate the 
									transition, I built and managed an Excel workbook within our Office 365 cloud environment 
									to keep track of every aspect of our new course delivery, since none of our existing systems 
									were prepared to handle such a switch, and no one could predict the extent or duration of 
									the lockdowns.  As a result of the measures I put into place, throughout the pandemic, 
									the team never lost track of a single hardware or software component, and I'm told that 
									the course delivery transition led to approximately $900,000 in revenue during one of the 
									pandemic's early fiscal quarters.</p>

									<h2>Education</h2>
									<p>Education is essential to a healthy, successful life.  I have three degrees from various institutions 
									across Canada, as well as a variety of certificates from my time as a public educator.  My most recent 
									venture was a bit more technical, however, completing a course on Front-end Web Development with 
									Lighthouse Labs in late 2021.  A brief description of some of my academic adventures can be found below.</p>

								<ul class="features">
								    <li>
										<img class="universityImage" src="images/lighthouseLabs.png" alt="" />
										<h3>Lighthouse Labs</h3>
										<p>Took a course from Lighthouse Labs on Front-end Web Development to keep working towards my goal of 
										becoming a full stack developer.  The course solidfied my skills in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, taught
										some design tips, and moved me into learning jQuery and connecting web APIs to my applications.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<img class="universityImage" src="images/UofC.png" alt="" />
										<h3>University of Calgary</h3>
										<p>Earned a Master of Education degree at the University of Calgary, specializing in 'Teaching and

									</li>
									<li>
										<img class="universityImage" src="images/CarletonU.png" alt="" />
										<h3>Carleton University</h3>
										<p>Earned a Bachelor of Arts honours from Carleton University as my undergraduate degree, specializing 
										in English literature and World histories.  This was a brutal, grinding degree that involved significant 
										reading and writing skills to accomplish.  I consider myself an expert in both for having done so.</p>
